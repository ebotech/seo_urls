= seo_urls

==Installation:

Copy the "truncate_helpers" folder into the /vendor/plugins folder in your project.

==Usage:

To apply this plugin to a model:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   seo_urls
end

==Information

The plugin looks for 'name' or 'title' attributes and if they are available it uses them to generate a search engine friendly string. to_params method is overwritten so that it returns the the numerical id of the record with the search engine friendly string appended to it.

An example model
@post=>{:id=>12,:title=>"seo_urls rails plugin"}

Without the plugin:
post_url(@post)=>"/posts/show/12"

With the plugin:
post_url(@post)=>"/posts/show/12-seo-urls-rails-plugin"

The plugin overwrites hte to_param method of the models it is applied to.
